    <p class="earth-text">Earth, the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, is the only known celestial body to support a vast array of life forms. With an equatorial diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers and an oblate spheroid shape, Earth's surface is marked by diverse landforms, including mountains, valleys, plains, and extensive water bodies such as oceans, seas, and lakes. Its atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), plays a crucial role in supporting life and moderating temperature. Earth's distance from the Sun, around 149.6 million kilometers on average, allows for a temperate climate conducive to life's existence. The planet's geology is dynamic, with tectonic activity shaping continents and creating seismic events. Earth has a powerful magnetic field generated by its iron-nickel core, shielding the planet from harmful solar radiation. The rotational axis gives rise to seasons, influencing climate patterns across the globe. Human civilization has flourished, utilizing Earth's resources for agriculture, industry, and technological progress. The intricate interplay of Earth's systems, including the water cycle, carbon cycle, and biodiversity, maintains a delicate ecological balance essential for the continuation of life on this remarkable celestial body.</p>
