    <p class="moon-text">The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, with a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles) and a distance of approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) from Earth. Exhibiting phases from New Moon to Full Moon in its roughly 27.3-day orbit, the Moon's surface showcases craters, mountains, and maria, large flat plains formed by ancient volcanic activity. With about 1/6th the gravity of Earth, the Moon's synchronous rotation means we consistently see the same face. Beyond its gravitational impact on Earth's tides, the Moon holds cultural significance and has been a focal point for scientific exploration missions, contributing to our understanding of the solar system and the universe at large. The Moon has played a crucial role in space exploration history, being the site of the Apollo missions where humans first landed in 1969. Recent lunar exploration efforts involve plans for establishing a sustainable human presence, with missions focusing on lunar colonization and resource utilization for potential future space endeavors.</p>
